This interaction could result in the creation of other particles, a change in the momentum or direction of q48460, or the emission of radiation.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about q48460 and its interactions with gauge bosons, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of putting the two in contact.

However, the process of European integration and the idea of a unified Europe can be traced back to the aftermath of World War II with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and the European Economic Community in 1957.\n\nDissolved, Abolished, or Demolished of European Community: The European Community, which was one of the three pillars of the European Union, ceased to exist with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on December 1, 2009.

However, while it did successfully reach Mars, the lander crash-landed on the planet's surface and was unable to transmit any useful data.
